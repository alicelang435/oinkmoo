                    Our Jasmine Green Tea is from the Xingbei District in Taiwan. It is made of smooth loose green tea leaves,
                    naturally scented by layers of jasmine blossoms. Our tea leaves infuse a natural clear jade color into the
                    tea and allow the drinker to experience a naturally fragrant scent.
